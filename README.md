# SLAX
Matlab Code for implementing SLAX
% Filename: Readme.txt

Main function file: "mainfun_SLAX" - this function is the main function and calls the following functions:
1) fun_ap_sim_B
2) fun_ap_imp_sim_B

Both functions "fn_ap_sim_B" and "fun_ap_imp_sim_B" call the function "fun_VFap_sim"

If needed, the function "fun_grid_gen" could be called from the "mainfun_SLAX" function (for further grid refinement)

Further details are provided in each of the functions.
